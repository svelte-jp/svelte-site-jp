Mark your calendars! [Svelte Summit Fall](https://www.sveltesummit.com/2023/fall) is on November 11th. Join us on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@SvelteSociety/streams) and in the [Discord](https://svelte.dev/chat) for hours of Svelte-focused fun ðŸŽ¥

Every month, maintainers within the Svelte ecosystem fix bugs, improve performance and bring new features to Svelte, SvelteKit and the tooling around them. This month's releases brings an improved developer experience with better [block folding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_folding), inferred types and configuration for `use:enhance`.

Let's take a closer look ðŸ‘€...

## What's new in Svelte & Language Tools

- Svelte 4.2.2 cleans up a few element-specific features ([Release Notes](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md#422))
- Extensions 107.12.0 improves block folding for functions, if statements and more ([Release Notes](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/releases/tag/extensions-107.12.0), [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2169))

## What's new in SvelteKit

- Route parameter types will now be inferred from the applicable matcher's guard check (**kit@1.26.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/advanced-routing#matching), [#10755](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/10755))
- The new `invalidateAll` boolean option lets you turn on and off the `invalidateAll()` form function within the `enhance` callback (**kit@1.27.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/form-actions#progressive-enhancement-use-enhance), [#9476](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/9476))
- The output of the project creation wizard will now reflect which package manager you're using (**create-svelte@5.1.1**, [#10811](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/10811))

For a complete list of bug fixes and performance updates, check out the [SvelteKit CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md). You can also find adapter-specific CHANGELOGs in each of [the `adapter` directories](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages).
