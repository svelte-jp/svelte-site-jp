Happy New Year! It's been a busy month for the Svelte maintainers - with tons of new features dropping in the Svelte 5 preview and the [release of SvelteKit 2](https://svelte.dev/blog/sveltekit-2)!

You can find all the new features in both projects below, along with a bunch of resources and sites built with Svelte in the Community Showcase.

Let's jump in...

## What's new in SvelteKit (2.0 and more!)

With its 2.0 release, SvelteKit is now more capable than ever. Be sure to check out the docs links in each update for more info on how to use each feature as well as the new [Performance](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/performance) page - which explains how SvelteKit works to make your applications as performant as possible.

- `resolvePath` has been replaced by `resolveRoute` in `$app/paths`. Use it to populate a route ID with params to resolve a pathname (**1.29.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#app-paths-resolveroute), [#11261](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11261))
- `response.arrayBuffer()` will now be inlined during SSR (**1.30.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#making-fetch-requests), [#10535](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/10535))
- [SvelteKit 2.0.0](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/main/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md#200) adds:
  - `untrack` to `load` to opt-out of invalidation ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#rerunning-load-functions-untracking-dependencies), [#11311](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11311))
  - shallow routing to create history entries without navigating ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/shallow-routing), [#11307](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11307))
  - html typings ([#11222](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11222))
  - redacted internal stack traces when reporting config errors ([#11292](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11292))
  - fine grained invalidation of search params ([Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#rerunning-load-functions), [#11258](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11258))

You can find a migration guide for SvelteKit 2.0 [on the SvelteKit docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/migrating-to-sveltekit-2). Things should be pretty seamless with the `svelte-migrate` command doing much (if not all) for you!


## What's new in Svelte

With [Svelte 5 in preview](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/introduction), Svelte 4 (`@latest`) has only been getting bug fixes - with its current version at `4.2.8`. The updates below are from version 5's preview branch:

- The new `$inspect` rune is like `console.log` except that it will re-run whenever its argument changes (**5.0.0-next.16**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes#inspect), [#9705](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9705))
- `$state` is now proxied to make reactivity nested by default. This is a response to user feedback with plenty of context in the PR - so check it out if you're interested on how the syntax has improved during the preview (**5.0.0-next.18**, [Docs/Examples](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/fine-grained-reactivity), [#9739](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9739))
- Fallback values for bindings are disallowed in runes mode since they're confusing, and a source of bugginess and implementation complexity (5.0.0-next.19, [#9784](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9784))
- Fallback props are now readonly (unless used with `bind:`). By extension, default values should also be readonly (**5.0.0-next.19**, [#9789](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9789))
- The new `unstate` function allows you to remove reactivity from objects and arrays created with `$state` (**5.0.0-next.19**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/functions#unstate), [#9776](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9776))
- GamepadEventHandlers for window.addEventListener (`gamepadconnected` and `gamepaddisconnected`) have been added (**5.0.0-next.23**, [Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GamepadEvent), [#9861](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9861))
- `{@const}` can now be used inside snippet blocks (**5.0.0-next.24**, [#9904](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9904))
- The new `$state.frozen` rune lets you access a read-only version of `$state` that cannot be mutated. This is useful if you want to work with data using immutable patterns rather than mutable patterns (**5.0.0-next.27**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes#state-frozen), [#9851](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9851))
