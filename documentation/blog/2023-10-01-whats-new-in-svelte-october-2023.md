Svelte 5 isn't out yet (you can, however, [preview it now](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/)), but that doesn't mean we don't get a sneak peek! Most notably are [Runes](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes) - a simpler way to manage reactive variables in Svelte code. There's lots of links the showcase section for deeper dives on all things Runes, but let's talk about what else been released this month...

## What's new in Svelte & Language Tools

- [Svelte 4.2.1](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md#421) was released with a bunch of fixes to HTML, CSS and sourcemap compilation
- [The latest version of the Svelte language tools](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/releases/tag/extensions-107.11.0) [enhances component references](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2157) in the "Find All References" command, [fixes a persistent issue with automated types going missing](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/pull/2160) after restarting a project and [adds fallback handling to auto-types](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/2156) (like those found in SvelteKit's `+server.js` files)

## What's new in SvelteKit

- `+server.js` now has a catch-all handler that handles all unimplemented valid server requests. Just export a `fallback` function! (**1.25.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server-fallback-method-handler), [#9755](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9755))

That's all for the new features! If you're looking for other patches and performance updates, check out the [SvelteKit CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md). You can also find adapter-specific CHANGELOGs in each of [the `adapter` directories](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages).
