Now let's dive into the updates...

## What's new in Svelte (5.0 Preview!)

[Svelte 5 preview](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/introduction) is now available at [svelte@next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte?activeTab=versions) while Svelte 4's current version (`@latest`) is `4.2.7`. All the changes below are from the preview's branch:

- TypeScript is now supported natively via acorn-typescript (**5.0.0-next.9**, [#9482](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9482))
- The new `$effect.active` rune returns a boolean to indicate if an effect is active. This lets you set up subscriptions when a value is read (in an effect, or in the template) but also read values without creating subscriptions (**5.0.0-next.10**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes#effect-active), [#9591](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9591))
- The new `$effect.root` rune creates a non-tracked scope that doesn't auto-cleanup. This is useful for nested effects that you want to manually control (**5.0.0-next.14**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes#effect-root), [#9638](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/9638))

For all the release notes going forward, check out [the CHANGELOG on main](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md). For the highlights, take a look below!
