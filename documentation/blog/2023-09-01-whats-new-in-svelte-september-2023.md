Happy September y'all! With all the [sneak peeks at what's coming soon in Svelte 5](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1688581184018583558), we thought it'd be best to look back at the last month to see what's shipped and what the community is building with Svelte.

Before we jump in, a warm welcome to the new Svelte Ambassadors: [@cainux](https://github.com/cainux) and [@grischaerbe](https://github.com/grischaerbe)! Welcome to the crew ‚õ¥Ô∏è

## What's new in Svelte & Language Tools

- `svelteHTML` has moved from language-tools into Svelte core so that `svelte/element` types will now load correctly (**4.2.0** in Svelte, **107.10.0** in Language Tools)

## What's new in SvelteKit

- `URL` is now accepted in the `redirect` function (**1.23.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#sveltejs-kit-redirect), [#10570](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/10570))
- Mistyped route filenames will now throw a warning (**1.23.0**, [#10558](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/10558))
- The new `onNavigate` lifecycle function enables view transitions - Check out the [blog post](https://svelte.dev/blog/view-transitions) for more info (**1.24.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#app-navigation-onnavigate), [#9605](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9605))

But that's just the new features! For all the patches and performance updates from this month, check out the [SvelteKit CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md). You can also find adapter-specific CHANGELOGs in each of [the `adapter` directories](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages).
