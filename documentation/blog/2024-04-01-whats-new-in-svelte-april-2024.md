Spring is just around the corner (for half the globe at least), which means [Svelte Summit Spring](https://www.sveltesummit.com/) is coming soon! The event will be streamed on [the Svelte Society YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/sveltesociety) on April 27.

Also, this month, a ton of new features have been merged into Svelte 5 to make it the best version of Svelte yet. We'll get into them all below, so let's jump right in!


## What's new in Svelte

[Svelte 5 is in preview](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/introduction) and gets closer to release every day. Below, you'll find some highlights from its [changelog](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md):

- The new `Map`, `Date` and `Set` classes can now be imported from `svelte/reactivity` and used just like their native counterparts to fit into Svelte's reactivity model (**5.0.0-next.79**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes#state-frozen-reactive-map-set-and-date), [#10803](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10803), [#10622](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10622), [#10781](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10781))
- state/derived/props can be explicitly exported from components again (**5.0.0-next.62**, [#10523](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10523))
- `bind:value` now allows for a dynamic `type` attribute - fixing issues with common input bindings (**5.0.0-next.66**, [#10608](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10608))
- `SSR` HTML mismatch validation has been improved and provides clearer error messages (**5.0.0-next.69**, [#10658](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10658))
- **Breaking:** Slots inside templates with a `shadowrootmode` attribute are now preserved (**5.0.0-next.73**, [#10721](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10721))
- **Breaking:** The `$props()` no longer accepts a generic type argument. Instead, component authors should type their props like any other variable declaration (**5.0.0-next.76**, [#10694](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10694))
- The new `$bindable` rune allows parents to `:bind` to a component's prop in addition to using them as regular props ([Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes#props-bindable), [#10851](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10851)) 
- The webkitdirectory DOM boolean attribute is now supported (**5.0.0-next.81**, [#10847](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10847))
- Form resets are now taken into account for two way bindings (**5.0.0-next.82**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/breaking-changes#other-breaking-changes-bindings-now-react-to-form-resets), [#10617](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10617))


## What's new in SvelteKit

- `adapter-vercel` now has Skew Protection which ensures that the client and server stay in sync for any particular deployment (**@sveltejs/adapter-vercel@5.2.0**, [Docs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/skew-protection), [#11987](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11987))
- `adapter-vercel`'s build output files now include framework metadata - improving observability on the platform (**@sveltejs/adapter-vercel@5.2.0**, [#11800](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11800))
- `adapter-cloudflare` and `adapter-cloudflare-workers` now implement `adapter.emulate` which allows the adapter to emulate the Cloudflare platform during dev and preview ([#11732](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11732))
- **Breaking:** `adapter-node` now shuts down gracefully and supports the new `IDLE_TIMEOUT` and `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` environment variables (**@sveltejs/adapter-node@5.0.1**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node#environment-variables-shutdown-timeout), [#11653](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11653))
- **Breaking:** The default value of `precompress` in `adapter-node` is now `true` - making sites faster by default (**@sveltejs/adapter-node@5.0.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node#options-precompress), [#11945](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11945))
- Google Cloud is now supported in `adapter-auto` without any additional configuration (**@sveltejs/adapter-auto@3.2.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-auto), [#12015](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/12015))
