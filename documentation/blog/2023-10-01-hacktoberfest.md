# Sveltekit ðŸ§¡ Hacktoberfest

We're excited to announce SvelteKit's participation in this year's Hacktoberfest! Hacktoberfest is a global event that takes place every October, during which developers are encouraged to contribute to open-source projects like SvelteKit. The goal is to foster a vibrant open-source community, celebrate shared knowledge, and make the world of coding more accessible to all. You can find other participating repositories by searching the [`hacktoberfest` topic](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest) on github.

## Getting Started

The first step is to [register for Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/register). Once you've registered, any PRs submitted to Sveltekit will count towards your participation in the event!

## Contributing

If you need inspiration when looking for an issue to fix, check out the [low hanging fruit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/labels/low%20hanging%20fruit), [contributions-welcome](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/labels/contributions-welcome), [ready to implement](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/labels/ready%20to%20implement), or [documentation](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/labels/documentation) tags.

It's a good idea to communicate clearly and often about what you're trying to solve or take on. You can do this by commenting on the issues you intend to take on. This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures that your contribution is in line with the project's goals. Nobody likes to have their work rejected, so it's best to ask questions early and often!

Join our [Discord](https://svelte.dev/chat) and ask questions in the dedicated `#hacktoberfest` channel. We're happy to help you get started!

We're excited to see what you've got in store for SvelteKit! Happy hacking! ðŸŽƒ
