This month, the Svelte maintainers made a ton of progress on Svelte 5 and Rich Harris talked to Prismic about how the team is working on making the framework even better.

Lots to showcase too... so let's dive in!


## What's new in Svelte

As you may already have heard, [Svelte 5 is in preview](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/introduction). In the meantime, Svelte 4 (`@latest`) has had [one bugfix](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/svelte-4/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md). The Svelte 5 changelog has quite a few updates, though:

- breaking: `$derived.call` is now `$derived.by` (**5.0.0-next.54**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes#$derived-by), [#10445](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10445))
- Destructuring derived object properties will now keep fine-grain reactivity (**5.0.0-next.55**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/runes#derived), [#10488](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10488))
- The new `hydrate` method makes hydration-related code treeshakeable (**5.0.0-next.56**, [Docs](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/functions#hydrate), [#10497](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10497))
- Nested CSS is now supported, along with better support for `:is(...)` and `:where(...)` (**5.0.0-next.57**, [#10490](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10490))
- breaking: The client-side API has been simplified by removing `createRoot`, adjusting the `mount`/`hydrate` APIs and introducing `unmount` (**5.0.0-next.58**, [Issue#9827](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/9827), [#10516](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/10497))

For all the bug fixes, chores and underlying work required to get Svelte 5 to release-ready, check out [the CHANGELOG on main](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md).


## What's new in SvelteKit

Mostly bug fixes, this month. Most notably is a fix to prevent stale values after navigation (**2.5.1**, [#11870](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11870)).

Adapters can also now use an `emulate` function to provide dev and preview functionality (**2.5.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/writing-adapters), [#11730](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11730)). This will allow for an improved experience developing for Cloudflare in the near future ([11732](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11732)).

For all the changes in SvelteKit, check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/main/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md).
