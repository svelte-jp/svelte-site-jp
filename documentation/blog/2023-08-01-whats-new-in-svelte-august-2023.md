Some sweet new features have dropped in both Svelte and SvelteKit, this month. It's also great to see how many products and side projects have launched using Svelte as their core technology!

More on all that down below...

## What's new in Svelte & Language Tools

There's been a bunch of minor bugfixes since the Svelte 4 release. You can find them in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/packages/svelte/CHANGELOG.md).

The **4.1.0 release** added the ability to further customize the custom element class that wraps the underlying Svelte component. Check out the [Custom Elements API docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/custom-elements-api) or the [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/8991) for more info!

In addition to supporting SvelteKit's new `HEAD` server method, Svelte's language tools now support Prettier v3 (**extensions-107.9.0**) and workspace trust settings are now used to support all settings in workspace (**extensions-107.8.0**).

## What's new in SvelteKit

- The `HEAD` server method is now available in API routes (**1.22.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server), [#9753](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9753))
- Responses with `Vary` headers are now cached, too (except for `Vary: *`) (**1.22.0**, [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server-content-negotiation), [#9993](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9993))
- There's now a more helpful error for preview if SvelteKit's build output doesn't exist (**1.22.2**, [#10337](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/10337))

For all the patches and performance updates from this month, check out the [SvelteKit CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md). You can also find adapter-specific CHANGELOGs in each of [the `adapter` directories](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages).
